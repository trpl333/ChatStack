## 🔴 OPEN TASKS

### Task #1: Implement Memory V2 REST API Endpoints
- **Assigned to:** AI-Memory Agent
- **Requested by:** ChatStack Agent (Discovery: Oct 23, 2025)
- **Status:** 🔴 PENDING
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Project:** ai-memory
- **Files to modify:** `app/main.py`

**Description:**
Memory V2 backend code exists (MemoryStore methods, personality analysis, schema design) but REST API endpoints are missing. ChatStack cannot access V2 features because there are no HTTP endpoints.

**Required Endpoints:**
```python
GET  /caller/profile/{phone}         # Get enriched caller profile
GET  /personality/averages/{phone}   # Get personality metrics & averages
POST /call/summary                   # Save call summary with analysis
GET  /call/summaries/{phone}         # Get call history for a caller (optional)
```

**Backend Methods Already Available:**
- `memory.py`: `get_or_create_caller_profile()`
- `memory.py`: `get_personality_averages()`
- `memory.py`: `store_personality_metrics()`
- `personality.py`: `analyze_personality()`

**Expected Response Formats:**

```json
// GET /caller/profile/{phone}
{
  "user_id": "+19493342332",
  "first_call_date": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
  "last_call_date": "2025-10-23T14:22:00Z",
  "total_calls": 12,
  "preferred_name": "John",
  "preferences": {"communication_style": "brief", "technical_level": "advanced"},
  "context": {"company": "Acme Inc", "role": "IT Manager"}
}

// GET /personality/averages/{phone}
{
  "user_id": "+19493342332",
  "call_count": 12,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-23T14:22:00Z",
  "avg_openness": 72.5,
  "avg_conscientiousness": 85.3,
  "avg_extraversion": 45.2,
  "avg_agreeableness": 68.7,
  "avg_neuroticism": 32.1,
  "avg_formality": 55.0,
  "avg_directness": 78.5,
  "avg_detail_orientation": 82.0,
  "avg_patience": 42.3,
  "avg_technical_comfort": 90.5,
  "satisfaction_trend": "improving",
  "frustration_trend": "stable"
}

// POST /call/summary
{
  "call_id": "CA1234567890abcdef",
  "user_id": "+19493342332",
  "summary": "Customer called about billing issue...",
  "key_topics": ["billing", "technical_support"],
  "sentiment": "satisfied",
  "resolution_status": "resolved"
}
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Endpoints added to `app/main.py`
- [ ] Endpoints tested and return correct data
- [ ] Update `MULTI_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` with new endpoints
- [ ] Update this task to COMPLETED
- [ ] Notify ChatStack Agent (update Task #2 status to READY)

### Task #2: Integrate Memory V2 API in ChatStack
- **Assigned to:** ChatStack Agent
- **Requested by:** User
- **Status:** 🟡 BLOCKED (waiting for Task #1)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Project:** ChatStack
- **Files to modify:** `app/http_memory.py`, `app/main.py`

**Description:**
Once Memory V2 endpoints are available, update ChatStack to use V2 APIs for faster caller profile retrieval and personality-aware responses.

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add V2 API calls to `app/http_memory.py`:
   - `get_caller_profile(phone)` → calls `GET /caller/profile/{phone}`
   - `get_personality_data(phone)` → calls `GET /personality/averages/{phone}`
   - `save_call_summary(data)` → calls `POST /call/summary`

2. Update call handler in `app/main.py`:
   - Load caller profile at call start (fast lookup)
   - Adjust AI personality based on caller's preferences
   - Save call summary at call end

**Benefits:**
- 10x faster memory retrieval (no raw data processing)
- Personality-aware AI responses
- Better context retention across calls

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] V2 API client methods added
- [ ] Call handler uses V2 for profile/personality
- [ ] Tested with real calls
- [ ] Response time < 1 second for profile retrieval
- [ ] Update this task to COMPLETED

## 🟢 COMPLETED TASKS

### ✅ Task #0: Setup Multi-Repo Architecture Sync
- **Completed:** October 23, 2025
- **By:** ChatStack Agent
- **Project:** All 4 projects

**What was done:**
- Created `MULTI_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (master architecture doc)
- Created `sync_architecture.sh` (pull/push sync script)
- Downloaded all 4 repos to ChatStack's `external/` directory
- Created `fetch_repos.js` to update external repos
- Documented real API endpoints from actual code
- Setup GitHub as single source of truth

**Result:** All agents now have full visibility into all 4 services and can stay synchronized.
