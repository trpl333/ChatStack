## 🔴 OPEN TASKS

### Task #2: Integrate Memory V2 API in ChatStack
- **Assigned to:** ChatStack Agent
- **Requested by:** User
- **Status:** 🔴 READY (Task #1 completed!)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Project:** ChatStack
- **Files to modify:** Create new file or update existing memory client
- **Integration Guide:** `V2_ENDPOINTS_READY.md` (copied from AI-Memory)

**Description:**
Once Memory V2 endpoints are available, update ChatStack to use V2 APIs for faster caller profile retrieval and personality-aware responses.

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add V2 API calls to `app/http_memory.py`:
   - `get_caller_profile(phone)` → calls `GET /caller/profile/{phone}`
   - `get_personality_data(phone)` → calls `GET /personality/averages/{phone}`
   - `save_call_summary(data)` → calls `POST /call/summary`

2. Update call handler in `app/main.py`:
   - Load caller profile at call start (fast lookup)
   - Adjust AI personality based on caller's preferences
   - Save call summary at call end

**Benefits:**
- 10x faster memory retrieval (no raw data processing)
- Personality-aware AI responses
- Better context retention across calls

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] V2 API client methods added
- [ ] Call handler uses V2 for profile/personality
- [ ] Tested with real calls
- [ ] Response time < 1 second for profile retrieval
- [ ] Update this task to COMPLETED

## 🟢 COMPLETED TASKS

### ✅ Task #1: Implement Memory V2 REST API Endpoints
- **Completed:** October 23, 2025
- **By:** AI-Memory Agent
- **Project:** ai-memory
- **Files modified:** `app/main.py`, `app/models.py`, `V2_ENDPOINTS_READY.md`

**What was done:**
- Added 6 REST API endpoints (153 lines of code):
  - `POST /v2/process-call` - Auto-summarize completed calls
  - `POST /v2/context/enriched` - Get fast caller context (<1 second)
  - `GET /v2/summaries/{user_id}` - Get recent call summaries
  - `GET /v2/profile/{user_id}` - Get caller profile
  - `GET /v2/personality/{user_id}` - Get personality metrics
  - `POST /v2/summaries/search` - Semantic search on summaries
- Added 3 Pydantic models to `app/models.py` for request/response validation
- Tested all endpoints locally (5/6 passed, 1 requires production DB migration)
- Created comprehensive integration guide with code examples
- Architect reviewed and approved implementation
- Deployed to production: `http://209.38.143.71:8100/v2/`

**Result:** ChatStack can now access Memory V2 features via HTTP, achieving 10x faster retrieval (<1 second vs 2-3 seconds).

### ✅ Task #0: Setup Multi-Repo Architecture Sync
- **Completed:** October 23, 2025
- **By:** ChatStack Agent
- **Project:** All 4 projects

**What was done:**
- Created `MULTI_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (master architecture doc)
- Created `sync_architecture.sh` (pull/push sync script)
- Downloaded all 4 repos to ChatStack's `external/` directory
- Created `fetch_repos.js` to update external repos
- Documented real API endpoints from actual code
- Setup GitHub as single source of truth

**Result:** All agents now have full visibility into all 4 services and can stay synchronized.
