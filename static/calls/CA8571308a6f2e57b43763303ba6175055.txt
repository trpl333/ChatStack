Jaya from Farmers Insurance called on behalf of Jacqueline Randolph, who wanted to speak with her agent of record, John Patterson. John was unavailable, so the agent offered to take a message. Jaya connected Jacqueline to the agent. Jacqueline stated she was calling about a payment made in July that was still showing as due. The agent initiated a transfer to a representative to assist with the payment inquiry.
